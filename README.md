# analyzere_solution

This is my solution for the Analyze Re programming challenge.

## Execution
Here are the steps to run the program.
```
1. git clone https://github.com/ayah-abaza/analyzere_solution
2. cd analyzere_solution
3. cat input | python ./compute.py 1000 20000000
```
You can replace `1000` and `20000000` with your desired threshold and limit values.
